# My reflection: I didn't know what to specifically make my website about, so I simply decided to do a very basic portfolio. I started with an empty repo, and then added my own index.html and style.css files. I also added an AGENT.md file thinking that I would use AI, but I ended up not using it much and instead used Co-Pilot separately. I initially had trouble getting GitHub pages to show what I put on my site, but I troubleshooted and got it working. I ended up having to change the name of the index.html file many times, but it eventually worked. Something important I learned is that the html file is like the bones, while the css file is like the clothing/decoration. After all the files were created I went to GitHub and published the page form main /root. This made GitHub look for my html file, and then it added the changes that I put. I learned about the structure of HTML, which CoPilot helped create for me. It gave me a template and broke down everything I needed. I worked in VS code and pushed everything from there, and also used GitHub on my desktop to commit things to the GitHub website.
